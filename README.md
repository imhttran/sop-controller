# SOP Controller

A local-first web dashboard for **SOP**. It gives a human a friendly
operational view of SOP projects — task state, execution progress, review
results, CI/validation state, handoff context, and failures — and exposes safe
SOP commands.

> **SOP stays the workflow authority.** The dashboard observes and commands SOP;
> it never keeps a second source of truth for task state.

## High-Level Architecture

Go HTTP server  (html/template + HTMX + CSS)

   v
SOP application/API boundary   internal/sopclient
   |
   v
SOP authoritative state        <project>/.agent-sdlc/state.db  (read-only)
                               sop CLI                        (commands)
```

Two planes, one authority:

- **`agentic-sop` / SOP** — automation and execution plane. SOP owns workflow
  state, legal state transitions, scheduling, gates, and human-approval
  boundaries.
- **`sop-controller`** — human visibility and control plane. It reads SOP's
  persisted state and delegates every action to SOP.

[docs/architecture/SOP-BOUNDARY.md](docs/architecture/SOP-BOUNDARY.md).

## Requirements

- **Go** (1.24+). That is it at build/run time.
- The **`sop` CLI** on `PATH` (or `SOP_BIN`) for the Run/Resume/Validate/Review
  commands. Read-only views work without it.

No Node, no npm, no PostgreSQL. Server-rendered HTML plus HTMX — no SPA.

## Quick Start

```bash
go run ./cmd/sop-controller     # foreground
# → http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

By default it reads SOP state from the current directory
(`./.agent-sdlc/state.db`). Point it at other projects with
`SOP_CONTROLLER_PROJECTS=...`, or let it discover every SOP project under a
workspace root with `SOP_CONTROLLER_WORKSPACES=...`.

Full setup, including phone access: [docs/guides/GETTING-STARTED.md](docs/guides/GETTING-STARTED.md).

## Basic Run Commands

```bash
make start     # build + run in the background
make status    # is it up? (also pings /healthz)
make logs      # tail the background log
make stop      # shut it down
```

`make help` lists every target. The dashboard itself drives SOP CLI commands
(`run`, `resume`, `validate`, `review`, `report`, `retry`, `reconcile`); see
[docs/reference/CLI.md](docs/reference/CLI.md).

## Basic Workflow

The controller reflects SOP's lifecycle; it does not own it. SOP decides what is
runnable, executes tasks, runs deterministic gates, and opens a human gate only
for a genuine unresolved decision. The controller displays that state and
delegates every action back to SOP.

## Documentation

Start at the documentation index: **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)** — it maps
every document with a one-sentence "when to read it".
Agent routing guide: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

The plan currently executing is whatever SOP records in
`.agent-sdlc/plan.meta.json` (`sop status` reports it) — not anything named in
this file. Historical artifacts under `docs/history/` are point-in-time and
non-normative.

## Status

Active and completed work is tracked by SOP, not by this README. See
[docs/plans/](docs/plans/) for current planning and [docs/history/](docs/history/)
for completed or superseded work.
